## üìÅ New Files Created

- `mailslurp-scraper.js` - Main scraper with MailSlurp integration
- `email-service.js` - Separate email service module
- `env-template.txt` - Configuration template
- `MAILSLURP-GUIDE.md` - This documentation

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Environment Configuration

Copy `env-template.txt` to `.env` and update the values:

```bash
cp env-template.txt .env
```

### 2. Configure Your Settings

Edit `.env` file:

```bash
# Your MailSlurp API key (provided)
MAILSLURP_API_KEY=c18e5e0c61756ce583cd95c9a4b72a5d0e449ac30aba96e65183bef2f53d116d

# Where to send job alerts
EMAIL_RECEIVER=your-email@example.com

# Keywords to filter jobs (comma-separated)
JOB_KEYWORDS=Software,Backend,Senior,Lead,Full Stack

# Schedule (every 2 days at midnight)
SCRAPE_INTERVAL=0 0 0 */2 * *
```

### 3. Test Email Service

```bash
npm run test-email
```

This will:
- Initialize MailSlurp
- Create/verify inbox
- Send a test email
- Confirm everything works

### 4. Run One-Time Check

```bash
npm run run-once
```

This will:
- Scrape current jobs
- Apply keyword filtering
- Show what would be emailed
- Create initial hash file

### 5. Start Continuous Monitoring

```bash
npm run mailslurp
```

This will:
- Run initial check
- Schedule future checks every 2 days
- Send emails only when new matching jobs appear

## üìã Available Commands

```bash
npm run mailslurp      # Start the MailSlurp scraper
npm run test-email     # Test email functionality
npm run run-once       # Single check without scheduling
```

## üîê How SHA256 Hash Works

1. **First Run**: Creates hash of all job listings ‚Üí saves to `jobs-hash.txt`
2. **Subsequent Runs**: 
   - Scrapes current jobs
   - Generates hash of current jobs
   - Compares with previous hash
   - **Only sends email if hash is different**

This ensures you only get notified when jobs actually change, not every time the scraper runs.

## üîë Keyword Filtering

The scraper searches for keywords in:
- Job titles
- Department names

**Example**: If your keywords are `Software,Backend,Senior`, it will match:
- "Senior Software Engineer"
- "Backend Developer" 
- "Software Engineering Manager"
- But NOT "Marketing Manager" or "Sales Associate"

### Default Keywords
```
Software, Backend, Frontend, Full Stack, DevOps, Data, 
Machine Learning, AI, Cloud, Senior, Lead, Principal
```

## üìß Email Features

### Rich HTML Formatting
- Professional layout with Airbnb colors
- Individual job cards with details
- Clickable apply buttons
- Keywords that triggered the alert
- Statistics summary

### Smart Subject Lines
```
üîî 3 New Airbnb Jobs - Senior Software Engineer, Backend Developer...
```

### Content Includes
- Job title (clickable link)
- Department and location
- Matched keywords highlighted
- Direct apply button
- Timestamp of when scraped

## üìä Logging & Monitoring

### Files Created
- `jobs-hash.txt` - Current hash for comparison
- `latest-jobs.json` - Last scraped job data
- `scraper-log.json` - Detailed activity log

### Log Entries Track

- Email sending success/failure

## ‚è∞ Scheduling Options

Default: Every 2 days at midnight
```bash
SCRAPE_INTERVAL=0 0 0 */2 * *
```

```bash
# Every day at 9 AM
SCRAPE_INTERVAL=0 0 9 * * *

# Every Monday and Friday at 9 AM
SCRAPE_INTERVAL=0 0 9 * * 1,5

# Every 6 hours
SCRAPE_INTERVAL=0 0 */6 * * *

```

## üõ† Troubleshooting
